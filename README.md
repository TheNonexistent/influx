A (Network) Security And Exploiting Tool Written In Python.

Consider That Influx Is Still In Development So There Can Be A Lot Of Problems With Modules Or The Core Itself. Please Report Any Issue And/Or Any Suggestion You Might Think Will Help Me Make It Better.

For Educational Purpose Only. Influx Is Not Responsible For Any Abusive/Offensive Use Of The Framework/Tool.

Useful Modules Will Be Added Soon. Some Of The Modules(Payload Generetor For Example) Are Only For Test And Will Be Removed Or Replaced.

Regards.
The Nonexistent.
